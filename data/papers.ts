    title: "Macroeconomic Expectations and Household Types: Evidence from Panel Data",
    category: "Selected Work in Progress",
    abstract: "Using expectations panel data of 11,302 US households, I analyze households' subjective models of macroeconomic outcomes and show that those models differentially affect planned consumption. To do this, I first use cluster analysis to classify households into types based on the interdependence of their expectations of four key macroeconomic variables: inflation, unemployment, interest rates, and stock prices. I find that households can be clustered into five types, of which three can be interpreted meaningfully: the first forms expectations consistent with economic concepts and the second consistent with a simple affective heuristic. The third seems to form expectations in isolation without interrelating variables. Second, I investigate the behavioral relevance of belonging to a type by analyzing the impact of households' inflation expectations on planned consumption. I find that the first and third - consistent with intertemporal substitution - increase planned spending with an increase in inflation expectations. The second - consistent with an income effect or precautionary saving - decreases planned spending. This research has policy implications for monetary and fiscal authorities seeking to influence household consumption patterns through policy measures.",

    title: "News Customization with AI",
    category: "Working Papers",
    abstract: "News outlets compete for engagement rather than reader satisfaction, leading to persistent mismatches between consumer demand and the supply of news. We test whether offering people the opportunity to customize the news can address this mismatch by unbundling presentation from coverage. In our AI-powered news app, users can customize article characteristics, such as the complexity of the writing or the extent of opinion, while holding the underlying news event constant. Using rich news consumption data from large-scale field experiments, we uncover substantial heterogeneity in news preferences. While a significant fraction of users demand politically aligned news, the vast majority of users display a high and persistent demand for less opinionated and more fact-driven news. Customization also leads to a better match between the news consumed and stated preferences, increasing news satisfaction.",
