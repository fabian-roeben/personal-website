    title: "Macroeconomic Expectations and Household Types: Evidence from Panel Data",
    abstract: "Using expectations panel data of 11,302 US households, I analyze households' subjective models of macroeconomic outcomes and show that those models differentially affect planned consumption. To do this, I first use cluster analysis to classify households into types based on the interdependence of their expectations of four key macroeconomic variables: inflation, unemployment, interest rates, and stock prices. I find that households can be clustered into five types, of which three can be interpreted meaningfully: the first forms expectations consistent with economic concepts and the second consistent with a simple affective heuristic. The third seems to form expectations in isolation without interrelating variables. Second, I investigate the behavioral relevance of belonging to a type by analyzing the impact of households' inflation expectations on planned consumption. I find that the first and third - consistent with intertemporal substitution - increase planned spending with an increase in inflation expectations. The second - consistent with an income effect or precautionary saving - decreases planned spending. This research has policy implications for monetary and fiscal authorities seeking to influence household consumption patterns through policy measures.",
