    title: "Macroeconomic Expectations and Household Types: Evidence from Panel Data",
    status: "Work in Progress",
    // journal: "Journal of Monetary Economics",
    // edition: "Vol. 104, Issue 1.",
    abstract: "Using expectations panel data of 11,302 US households, I analyze households' subjective models of macroeconomic outcomes and show that those models differentially affect planned consumption. To do this, I first use cluster analysis to classify households into types based on the interdependence of their expectations of four key macroeconomic variables: inflation, unemployment, interest rates, and stock prices. I find that households can be clustered into five types, of which three can be interpreted meaningfully: the first forms expectations consistent with economic concepts and the second consistent with a simple affective heuristic. The third seems to form expectations in isolation without interrelating variables. Second, I investigate the behavioral relevance of belonging to a type by analyzing the impact of households' inflation expectations on planned consumption. I find that the first and third - consistent with intertemporal substitution - increase planned spending with an increase in inflation expectations. The second - consistent with an income effect or precautionary saving - decreases planned spending. This research has policy implications for monetary and fiscal authorities seeking to influence household consumption patterns through policy measures.",

    // abstract: "In large-scale experiments, we study people's news consumption on a news platform, TailorMadeTimes, that enables users to customize news articles in terms  of their entertainment, negativity, political perspective, and complexity. As users set their preferences, the website dynamically generates and presents AI-created news content tailored in real time, while holding constant the underlying facts from a credible source. According to our framework, the AI website decreases search and matching frictions for consumers. Our experiments shed light on the demand for and the consequences of AI customization. First, we provide evidence that AI customization significantly increases news consumption. Second, sing rich click data, we characterize how people customize their news in practice. Third, we study the causal effect of AI customization on knowledge acquisition, issue polarization and affective polarization.",

    // abstract: "We introduce a novel method using large-language models to identify detailed narratives in sovereign bond markets and create a sentiment index based on their implications for bond prices. Analyzing earnings call transcripts from 2003 to 2023, our sentiment index strongly correlates with bond spread movements and outperforms previous sentiment extraction methods. We identify ca.~20 narratives influencing European bond prices. This study pioneers the use of large-language models for financial sentiment analysis, demonstrating superior performance over traditional approaches.",
