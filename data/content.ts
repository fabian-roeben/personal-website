I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at the [University of Cologne](https://wiso.uni-koeln.de/en/) working at the intersection of economics and AIâ€”both using AI in economic research and studying AI as an economic force. Methodologically, I use LLMs and text-as-data, machine learning, causal inference, and experiments and surveys.
